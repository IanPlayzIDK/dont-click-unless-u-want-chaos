i dont know if i have alot of uneccisary code but i am trying to get a script that opens infinite tabs untill your laptop/pc crashes.
so if anyone could dm me on discord (friend me im @IanLuian) if u know any way to do this. i am no expirenced html coder just a bit of bash and thats it. so yeah if u could help me out that'd be nice.
to see the code just open the "tab opener" file in notepad or some text editor u have.
